🏗️ Project INTEGRITY
Restoring Public Trust Through Agentic AI & Community Oversight.

📌 Overview
Project INTEGRITY is a decentralized audit ecosystem that bridges the gap between official government promises and ground reality. By combining Citizen-led reporting with Agentic AI workflows, we detect discrepancies in public infrastructure projects (like roads, water, and sanitation) to prevent "ghost projects" and fund misappropriation.

🚀 Key Features

👤 For Citizens (Whistleblowers)

1.Privacy-First Reporting: Submit reports anonymously to ensure safety while exposing corruption.
2.Anti-Tamper Evidence: Automatic high-precision GPS and timestamp logging for every photo captured.
3.Auto-RTI Generation: One-click AI generation of formal RTI (Right to Information) applications based on verified reports.

🛡️ For Auditors (Admin Control)

1.Agentic Audit Workflow: An autonomous AI process that compares citizen evidence against government records to generate a structured Risk Level.
2.Departmental Performance Tracking: A macro-view dashboard that groups issues by category (Roads, Water, Garbage) to monitor sector-wise accountability.
3.Geospatial Visualization: Interactive heatmaps (Mapbox/Leaflet) to identify high-corruption hotspots in real-time.

🤖 The "Agentic Audit" Engine

The heart of Project INTEGRITY is our 3-stage autonomous audit pipeline:

  1.Retrieval: The system fetches "Official Records" (metadata extracted from government PDFs via LLMs).

  2.Comparison: Computer Vision analyzes the citizen's photo and compares it with the project's technical blueprints or promised status.

  3.Verdict: AI generates a reasoning-based verdict (e.g., "Discrepancy: Road reported as 100% complete in records, but visual evidence      shows 0% construction.").
